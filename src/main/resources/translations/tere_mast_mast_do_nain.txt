Your two passionate eyes

They keep watching you evening and morning / in my eyes, alas, in my eyes, oh !

[first stanza]
They keep watching you evening and morning
Your eyes are like dwelling in my eyes

[repeats first stanza]

[refrain]
Your two passionate eyes
Have taken the peace of my heart [both lines x2]

When I first saw you, My heart beat - Ah! My heart beat, My heart beat [x2]

I burnt, I am whom are the flame of love aggravated - Oh, the flame of love aggravated

Since your dreams mixed in my sleep
It seems that my style has changed [x2]

[repeats refrain]

[feminine voice]
What started from you, May end to you -  My world, the world of mine [x2]

This was in heart which eyes said - I am yours, I am yours, I am yours

My heart is filled with sighs when I remember you
I can't meet you even after meeting, Now, What do I do? [x2]

[repeats refrain]
[repeats first stanza]
[repeats refrain several times]
