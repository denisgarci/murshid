The pain of our hearts

The pain of out hearts would shorten
If You and I, we came together. [x2]
How beautiful the world would become
if You and I, we came together!

Without You I can’t find peace,
I can’t find rest

All the misapprehensions/misconceptions would be eradicated
If You and I would unite


As love is incomplete, the world seems incomplete
Come and fulfil my wishes
The heart just desires, That our
love story becomes complete
All the difficulties would become easy
If You and I would unite

How beautiful the world would become
If You and I, we came together.


There’s nothing left, still the heart doesn’t heed to me
The talks of the heart can only be understood by itself
May we meet someplace, someday,
I’m alive only on this hope

I would accomplish all ambitions
If You and I, we came together.
