The pains of our hearts

[stanza 1]
The pains of our hearts would shorten
If you and I became united. [x2]

[stanza 2]
How beautiful conditions would become
if you and I became united.

Without you I can’t find peace,
I can’t find rest

All those confusions would became averted
if you and I became united.

Love is incomplete, the world is incomplete
why don't you come and fulfill my wish?

This very heart indeed desires, that this love story,
yours and mine, becomes complete

Every difficulty would become easy
if you and I became united.

[repeats stanza 2]

There’s nothing left, but the heart doesn’t obey;
the things of the heart, (only) the heart understands.

We both will meet one day elsewhere,
I’m really alive (only) on this hope.

Every goal would be reached
if you and I became united.
