With Fevicol

[female singer]
[moans] When I stretch arms in earnest, in earnest ...
[uff!] When I stretch my arms in earnest, in earnest ...

The sounds of "oh" "ah" come from all sides
I walk in such a way, that it stirs a riot
Even the sensible seem groggy

[refrain]
My photo … my photo on the the chest, friend
stick it with Fevicol, beloved,

… with Fevicol, with Fevicol

I am really … ah, I am ready since (such a long time)
Settle it, beloved, with a "missed call", my photo on the chest
stick it with Fevicol, beloved

Swing, swing, swing, ceaselessly, swing, swing, swing [x2]
Swing in joy, swing [x2]

[male singer]
[hmm … ] Make love to the daughter of a grape
Make love to the daughter of a grape

You will forget the precepts with one quarter (of a drink)
Besides, to the drinkers goes the joy of living.
This is that liquor which raises (intoxicates) just with water

[female singer]
Come my king, I shall make you see paradise
Let me set fire into the ice cold water

[male singer]
The whole of India …
Alas, you have made the whole of India slave

[female singer]
I am tandoori, I am really a tandoori chicken
Swallow with alcohol, beloved [Oh, yeah!]

[repeats refrain]

People tell me that I am salty (savoury) butter [x2]

I will cut out (your) heart, my youth is a cutter
The one who sees my moves starts fainting
Keep closed the shutter of your eyes

[male singer]
The public of the city is just waiting for you…
… hey! …
If you were to sway (your) little waist, the district, nay, the state would shake!

Although your story …
Although your story, oh queen, is old

nevertheless the photo, on my chest, friend
I will stick it with Fevicol

[female singer]
My Gypsy (a vehicle model) with siren is ready
I'll race it with this petrol

with this petrol [x2]

[repeats refrain]

[male singers in chorus]
… with Fevicol, with Fevicol

We will meet gazes with a Baby Doll
Uh, we will seduce a lass with a missed call

[all singers in counterpoint]
With bat and ball, with cinema hall,
with marriage hall, with overall

[repeats refrain x 2]
