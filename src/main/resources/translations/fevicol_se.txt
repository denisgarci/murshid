With Fevicol

[moans] When I stretch arms in earnest, in earnest ...
[uff!] When I stretch my arms in earnest, in earnest ...

The sounds of "oh" "ah" come from all sides
I walk in such a way, that it stirs a riot
Even the sensible seem groggy

My photo … my photo on the the chest, friend
stick it with Fevicol, beloved, with Fevicol, with Fevicol

I am really … ah, I am ready since (such a long time)
Settle it, beloved, with a "missed call", my photo on the chest
stick it with Fevicol, beloved

Swing, swing, swing, ceaselessly, swing, swing, swing
Swing, swing, swing, ceaselessly, swing, swing, swing
Swing in joy, swing
Swing in joy, swing

[hmm … ] Make love to the daughter of a grape
Make love to the daughter of a grape

You will forget the precepts with one quarter (of a drink)
Besides, to the drinkers goes the joy of living.
This is that liquor which raises (intoxicates) just with water

Come my king, I shall make you see paradise
Let me set fire into the ice cold water

The whole of India …
Alas, you have made the whole of India a slave

I am like a barbequed chicken
Swallow me with a glass of alcohol

My photo to Your Heart
Stick it with Fevicol my beloved

People call me a savoury butter
People call me a savoury butter

I will cut out Your heart my youth is like a cutter
The one who sees my moves starts fainting

Keep closed the shutter of Your eyes
The whole public of the city is waiting for You

The movement of Your waist makes the whole state tremble?

Your story
Your story, O queen is old

But still Your Photo to my heart
I will stick it with Fevicol

My car with the siren is ready
I'll race it with this petrol


My photo to Your Heart
Stick it my beloved
Stick it with Fevicol my beloved

With Fevi-Fevicol, with Fevicol

My eyes will connect with the Baby Doll
I'll try and flirt with girls with a Miss Call
With bat and ball, With cinemal hall
With marriage hall, with overall

Your Photo to my heart
I will stick it with Fevicol

My photo to Your Heart
Stick it my beloved
Stick it with Fevicol, my beloved
