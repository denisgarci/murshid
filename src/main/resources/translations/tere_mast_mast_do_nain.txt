Your two amorous eyes

They keep watching you evening and morning / in my eyes, oh, in my eyes, oh !

[first stanza]
They keep watching you evening and morning
Your eyes are like dwelling in my eyes

[repeats first stanza]

[refrain]
Your two amorous eyes
Have taken the peace of my heart [both lines x2]

When I first saw you, my heart indeed throbbed, ah! it throbbed, throbbed, ah, it throbbed [x2]

The flame of love that I suddenly ignited flares, ah, it flares, ah, it flares

In my sleep, dreams that are yours become mixed
My manners seem to be like changed [x2]

[repeats refrain]

[feminine voice]
My world, my world has stated with you, indeed should end at you

These were things inside the heart, but the eyes said them aloud / I am yours, I am yours

Upon remembering you, I am filled with sighs
I meet you without really meeting you, now what should I do? [x2]

[repeats refrain]
[repeats first stanza]
[repeats refrain several times]
