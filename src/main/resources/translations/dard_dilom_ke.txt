The pains of our hearts

The pains of our hearts would shorten
If You and I came together. [x2]
How beautiful conditions would become
if you and I became united!

Without You I can’t find peace,
I can’t find rest

All those confusions would became averted
if you and I became united!


As love is incomplete, the world seems incomplete
Come and fulfil my wishes
The heart just desires, That our
love story becomes complete
All the difficulties would become easy
if you and I became united.

How beautiful the world would become
if you and I became united!


There’s nothing left, still the heart doesn’t heed to me
The talks of the heart can only be understood by itself
May we meet someplace, someday,
I’m alive only on this hope

I would accomplish all ambitions
If You and I, we came together.
