Goodbye

How is it possible, that these moments are sprinkled with broken relationships ?
It is as if these moments were spilled from eyelashes of sadness.

Why is this tale incomplete?
Why is this romance incomplete?
Why, within its boundaries, is there
a goodbye?

Lifelong company given. why only that would be love ?
Why isn't also love, that which is erased and departed ?

This tale is not incomplete.
This romance is not incomplete.
Even after dying, we won't say
goodbye.

[refrain - uses Hindi and Punjabi-sounding words without clear sense:

  मेरे रब्बा = "My God"
  यह कहानी = "this story"
  ... but the rest is difficult to understand]

Which thirst is this, that doesn't leave when I do?
you are lost in the distance, but still close to me

Because you are my tale,
because you are my romance.
Now, we don't have to say
goodbye again.

[duet]
I caress your memories / don't say
One moment I am composed, then ruined / [hums]
In this world, you became lost  / goodbye
is there no
sorrow of broken solitudes?

[repeats refrain]

[duet]
How is it possible, that these moments are sprinkled with broken relationships ? / don't say
It is as if these moments were spilled from eyelashes of sadness. / goodbye

Why is this tale incomplete? / [hums]

[ah - ah - ah ] ... goodbye ...
