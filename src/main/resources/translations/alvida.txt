Goodbye

How is it possible, that these moments are sprinkled with broken relationships ?
It is as if these moments were spilled from eyelashes of sadness.

Why is this tale incomplete?
Why is this romance incomplete?
Why, within its boundaries, is there
a goodbye?

Company which given for a lifetime, why only that would be love?
Isn't it also love, if it is erased and destroyed?

This tale is not imcomplete.
This romance is not incomplete.
Even after dying, we won't say
goodbye.

[refrain - uses Hindi and Punjabi-sounding words without clear sense:

  मेरे रब्बा = "My God"
  यह कहानी = "this story"
  ... but the rest is difficult to understand]

What is this thirst, that doesn't leave when I am gone?
you are lost in the distance, but still close to me

Because you are my love story,
because you are my story.
From now on, goodbye
doesn't have to be said

[duet]
I caress your memories / remember how much
One moment I am composed, then distraught / [hums]
In this world, you became lost  / goodbye
is there no
sorrow of broken solitudes?

[repeats refrain]

[duet]
How come, these moments are sprinkled with broken relationships / don't say
It is as if these moments were spilled from eyelashes of sadness. / goodbye

Why is this love story incomplete? / [hums]

[ah - ah - ah ] ... goodbye ...
